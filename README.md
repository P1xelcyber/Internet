# Internet
It's a project made for Network troubleshot or information gathering

# Beta
note that the program was done in 2 days full of programming and the options in the program like "Test if your connection is stable." they are perfectlyfine but i can add more features if needed just send me message on reddit.

# Bugs
if u find any bugs or issues then feel free to send me a message on reddit. I will try to fix the issue.

# OS
it's currently only linux but i will try to bring it on windows.

# Use
if u are on linux then open terminal in the directory the file is in or just navigate to it. after u found it just type './Internet' and it should work, but if you get an error try it with root

# Education
you can also open the source file and you can study the program to practice your skills.

# Features
as i said it is in beta version so it doesn't have alot of features, but if u have ideas the leave me a message on reddit.
